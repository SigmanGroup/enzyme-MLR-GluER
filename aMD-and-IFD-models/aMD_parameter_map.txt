***aMD_Descriptors***

***This explains the parameters in the Excel sheet "aMD_parameters.xlsx" which was used for all aMD modeling and model validation***

Descriptors x1 to x6 are the dynamic surface areas (DSA) and volumes (DV) of substrates and products, and the difference in substrate and product DSA and DV

Descriptors x7 to x78 are ligand-specific, DFT-derived descriptors for substrates (including Boltzmann averaged [BA], max, min, and max-min values for each descriptor)

Descriptors x79 to x102 are the residue-specific DSAs and DVs of FMN and active site residues

Descriptors x103 to x578 are residue-specific descriptors (including the descriptor weighted by the number of MD frames represented by a structure [MD_wt], and the min, max, and max-min values)

Descriptors x579 to x602 are ligand-specific, DFT-derived descriptors for substrates
