# python-modeling

To use: implemented as a Jupyter notebook, ideally the Excel file will be in the same directory as the scripts. 
To set up conda environment: use the provided yml file 

conda env create -f modeling_environment.yml (sets up the environment with the necessary packages, only needs to be run once)
conda activate modeling (activates the environment)
  - if this doesn't work, it is likely because the yml was exported on a different platform than your machine. To troubleshoot, first try running the same command but with the modeling-environment_2.yml, which has no builds included.
