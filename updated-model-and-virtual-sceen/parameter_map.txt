***aMD_Descriptors***

***This explains the data and parameters in the Excel sheets "updated_model_input.xlsx" and "virtual_screen_input.xlsx" ***

For updated_models_input.xlsx:

Data entries in bold text were added after the screens of out-of-sample substates and mutants from initial aMD and IFD models

Descriptors x1 to x6 are the dynamic surface areas (DSA) and volumes (DV) of substrates and products, and the difference in substrate and product DSA and DV

Descriptors x7 to x78 are ligand-specific, DFT-derived descriptors for substrates (including Boltzmann averaged [BA], max, min, and max-min values for each descriptor)

Descriptors x79 to x102 are the residue-specific DSAs and DVs of FMN and active site residues

Descriptors x103 to x578 are residue-specific descriptors (including the descriptor weighted by the number of MD frames represented by a structure [MD_wt], and the min, max, and max-min values)

Descriptors x579 to x602 are ligand-specific, DFT-derived descriptors for substrates 

Descriptors x603 to x620 are cluster DSA and DV descriptors as described in Table S3 of the associated manuscript 

Descriptors x621 to x665 are inter-residue distance measurements as described in Table S3 of the associated manuscript

Descriptors x666 to x745 are phi and psi angle measurements

Descriptors x746 to x833 are residue and backbone atom RMSD measurements


For updated_models_input.xlsx:

Data entries hilighted in yellow are the mutants that we had not previously tested in the biocatalytic reaction; they were subjected to the virtual screen.

Descriptors x1 to x8 are the parameters from the updated statistical model in Figure 4 of the associated manuscript
